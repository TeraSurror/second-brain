Syntax:
```
SELECT
	column_names/expression
FROM
	table
LIMIT row_count
```

The above command returns the first 'row_count' rows generated by the query

**OFFSET:**
Syntax
```
SELECT
	column_names/expression
FROM
	table
LIMIT row_count OFFSET rows_to_skip
```
This command skips the first 'row_to_skip' number of rows.

This should be used with ORDER BY clause as LIMIT returns the data in an unspecified order.
Example usage:

```postgresql
SELECT film_id, title, release_year
FROM film
ORDER BY film_id
LIMIT 10;
```

**To get top/bottom N values:**
- Sort the data using the order by clause
- Then use limit to get the first n values
Eg. To get the top 10 most expensive films:
```postgresql
SELECT film_id, title
FROM film
ORDER BY rental_rate DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
