In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or PoS tagging or POST), also called grammatical tagging is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. 

A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school-age children, in the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.

Example:

| Lexical Term | tag | example |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| noun | NN | something, nothing |
| verb | VB | learn, study |
| determinator | DT | the, a |
| w-adverb | WRB | why, where |
