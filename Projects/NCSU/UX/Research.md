### Long term goals
FMX is a leading provider of facilities and maintenance management solutions. The task assigned to our team involves merging existing issues raised on the application. 
The main goal of our project is to improve the efficiency of deployment of maintenance workers and resources in order to save time, man-power and cost. We want to ensure that when duplicate issues are raised, they are merged in a completely automated manner. This reduces the effort on the supervisor's end. In the future, we also want to make sure that duplicate issues are not raised in the first place. This would be achieved by notifying the requester (the person who raises the issues) that the issue already exists and should not be created.

### Target
Our team will try to solve the issue of identifying the duplicate issues that come up on the  FMX application. The supervisor will handle the merging of the issues. We have to ensure that the supervisor can clearly find out duplicate issues and can easily notify the requesters about the status of their raised issues. This will ensure that resources aren't deployed unnecessarily and this can potentially save time, man-power and cost.
