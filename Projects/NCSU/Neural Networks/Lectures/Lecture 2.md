AI :  Aims to mimic intelligence
ML: Uses data to learn functions and relationships
DL: uses neural networks 

Deep Neural Network: NN which has a lot of layers

### Machine Learning

ML is like a black box which converts inputs into labels

**Generalization**: giving an ML model new data it hasn't seen to test how it works

Types:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
##### Training and Testing
Inference Task: The goal is a function such that y = f(x) {x is input and y is output}

Training:
- we make a prediction function.
- we try to find out well a NN performs. We do that by using a loss function.
- Loss function gives us a cost and this is the cost we are trying to reduce.
Testing:
- we determine how well a model perform. we use a performance metric to do that
- Note: performance metric can be the loss function as well.
