Where Generatve AI lies in the Artificial Intelligence context:
Artificial Intelligence => Machine Learning => Deep Learing => Generative AI
AI: any task that enables computers to mimic human behavior
GenAI: produces new data based on the context (or past information)

Evolution of Open AI models 
1. better at coding
2. better at following instructions
3. better at understanding follow-ups
4. got cheaper

Why embrace Generative AI:
1. Shorter innovation cycles
2. Modernize automation infrastructure
3. Engineers spend more time on real code

Engineering Productivity
 - Only 30% percent of time is actually spend on coding

AI-Augmented development (how Gen AI helps in writing code):
- design-to-code tools
- coding assistants
- testing tools
- documentation tools

Accelerated AI Augmented Development:
Dev Code: approx 60M lines
Test Code: approx 109M lines
So if test code can be automated, lots of productivity can be gained

Negatives of GenAI:
1. Cultural resistances
2. Inappropriate use
3. Error-prone models
4. Enterprise data safety
5. Licensing - copyrighting issues
6. AI hallucinations

Future of Software Engineering:
1. Focus on AI-first principals and designs
2. design and creative work will become more important
3. legal and ethical considerations
