Title: Harnessing Mobile Technologies for Healthcare Equity and Fairness
Speaker: Huining Li - University of Buffalo

Solution: Mobile tech to increase access to healthcare to all kinds of people in call kinds of geographies (call this mHealth)

Mobile tech can worsen the situation if not dealt with properly. Ex, privacy issues and incorrect diagnosis. 

Implementation challenges in mHealth
1. sensor size - challenge to fit in mobile devices
2. Privacy of users
3. Scaling of data causes challenges in managing data (again leads to privacy issues)

Research of speaker:
1. child development:
	1. speech annotation tool - helps with speech disorder
2. epidemic disease
	1. COVID - 19 detection
	2. Mental issues during the pandemic
3. Chronic disease in the elderly
	1. Parkinson's disease management
	2. Wound healing tracking
	3. Cardiovascular disease treatment

Core CPS techniques
1. Wireless signal processing and profiling
2. Privacy aware mobile computing


Smartphone-bases Parkinson's disease management:
- About 1B people in the US live with Parkinson's Disease (PD). More in cities than in rural areas
- There is a huge disparity in the neurologists in the US
Research in the field:
- speech based PD detection
- non-speech PD detection
- PD medication adherence detection
- PD medication effectiveness detection
Medication helps PD patients, but some of them may experience drug resistance.
Best way to deal with this is to visit a neurologist. But this needs good time management and missing treatments can be detrimental.

Mobile Mental health study
- people from marginalized communities have a higher chance of getting mental illnesses
- They do not feel comfortable in seeking treatment from other people
- The speaker created a mobile app called Mellowing Mind that gives health interventions to these people
- Partnered with University of Buffalo Nursing school to test the application.
- They held online sessions for users to teach how to use the application.
How user interacts with the app
1. Self reflection
2. Emotion state self assessment
3. Practice mindfulness by watching helpful videos

Future scope of mobile health
- privacy in brain computer interfaces
- incorporate fairness in mHealth services
