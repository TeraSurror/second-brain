## Requirements Engineering and Traceability

### Requirement
- a need or constraint imposed by a stakeholder
- a capability or property a system can have
- a documented representation of a need, capacity or property
- **REQUIREMENTS DEAL WITH PROBLEMS**

Types
1. **Functional Requirements**: what a system should do
2. **Non-Functional Requirements**: the constraints part

Purpose:
1. basis for agreement b/w customers and suppliers
2. basis for estimating costs and schedules
3. reduction of dev effort
4. baseline for validation and effort
5. easier transfer of software product to new users or machines

Where do requirements come from
1. Stakeholder: they have justifiable claim to be allowed to influence the requirements
2. people who are affected by the system
3. users of the system and development
4. managers who want the system to succeed
5. regulators who are worried about the effects of the system

### Requirements Engineering

**Def**: "Requirements Engineering (RE) is the systematic, iterative, and
disciplined approach to develop an explicit requirements and system
speciﬁcation that all stakeholders agree upon."

**Goal**: The deﬁnition of the elementary properties (requirements) of a
software system, product, service, and / or development process itself as
the basis for the development project’s success.
