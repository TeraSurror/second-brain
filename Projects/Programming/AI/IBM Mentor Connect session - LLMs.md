- Traditional AI is majorly based on supervised learning
- We have leveraged 40% traditional AI

### Generative AI:

- no training involved
- feed data into model and get some output (output has to be modified)
- self supervised learning - not always accurate
###### Use cases:
1. Retrieval augmented generation
2. Summarization
3. Content generation
4. Named entity recognition
5. Insight extraction
6. Classification


### LLM Hallucinations
- This means when a model gives factually incorrect data. C
- Could be an error in training data and architecture
- Statistical oops!
