Each AWS Region has an availability zone.

Each region has at min 3 and at most 6 zones.

- Each zone has one or more data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity
- Each zone is isolated from each other so that data can be preserved in case of any disasters
- Each zone has high connectivity, with ultra-low latency


Eg. AWS Region Sydney (code: ap-southeast-2) will have ap-southeast-2a, ap-southeast-2b, ap-southeast-2c.
