I read the Warnock interview. I struck by rigorously he sticks with his core beliefs of doing things the "right" way and things satisfying his own definition of being "aesthetic". This is not only reflected in his personal life, but also in the way Adobe does things. This strict adherence to a certain set of "core" beliefs is common with many other successful entrepreneurs and businessmen. It almost permeates in every aspect of their life - almost like an obsession. In case of Warnock, these core beliefs even extend to the way things are run at in Adobe - down the products they make and systems they use to make these products. For instance, even after he made significant innovations in the world of printer through the development of PostScript, he realized that the world was shifting to the internet and transferring PostScript files over networks was not ideal. In other words, there needed to be a "right" way, or at least a better way of transferring documents over the internet. This lead to him creating the PDF format - which is now used everywhere in the world. I was also surprised at the origins of PDF. The fact that a digital document format emerged form a technology that made for running on printers is extremely impressive.
