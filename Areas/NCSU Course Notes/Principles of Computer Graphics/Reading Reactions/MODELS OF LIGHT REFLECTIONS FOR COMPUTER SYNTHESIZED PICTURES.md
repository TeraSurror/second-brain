For the illumination reading, I read the "Models of light reflections for computer synthesized pictures". I found it interesting that illumination (or brightness) can be expressed as a function the angle between the surface of reflection and the eye. Some questions that came to mind were, why is the normal (as opposed to the surface plane) is considered in the diffuse reflection equation? and how are some of the parameters mentioned in the models (eg. light vectors, normal vector to the surface, tilt angle between the surface and the eye) are calculated in real-life? and how these models take "shininess" into consideration.
