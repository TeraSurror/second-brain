For this week's task, I read "The Design of the OpenGL Graphics Interface" by Segal and Akeley. Few questions that came to mind were, how did the OpenGL team create the software architecture (or write the code) for the design considerations they had to make like orthogonality and interoperability, how did they make sure the API was essentially "hardware independent" and what algorithms they used to implement things like shading, ray tracing, rasterization, etc. I was also fascinated by how efficient they made the API. I also wonder what multi-threading or parallelization paradigms they use to improve efficiency today. #reading #webgl
