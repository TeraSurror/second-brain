I read 'An Improved Illumination Model for Shaded Display' by Turner Whitted this week. My first thought was that there are a lot of considerations made to represent illumination mathematically. I was also surprised at the amount of time it took to generate the images. Few questions that came to mind were how did they consider the glossiness of the surface for the illumination and how can an object be mapped to a sphere of infinite radius. I will try to read the references to understand more. #reading #raytracing
