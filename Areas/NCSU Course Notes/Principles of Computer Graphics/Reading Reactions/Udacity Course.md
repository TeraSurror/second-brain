For this week's assignment, I watched video #191 and #201 of the Udacity Course - Interactive 3D Graphics. The translation video reminded me of the translate operation in CSS which can be used to position DOM elements. We can use a timer to make the translate operation slower. This can make the DOM element look like it is moving. This can be used to create page transition effects in websites. I believe something similar can achieved using Javascript as well.  I found the second video a liitle hard to understand. But after several rewatching it was clear how he achieves angular translation. #reading #modeling
