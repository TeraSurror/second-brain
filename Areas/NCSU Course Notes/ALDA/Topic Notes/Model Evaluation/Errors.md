**Optimistic error:** The error you actually get, i.e, number of mis-classification / number of classifications

**Pessimistic error:**
For binary tree:
For each node -> e(t) = e(t) * 0.5 (0.5 can be any value)
Total error -> e(t) = e(t) + (N * 0.5)


**Occam's Razor**:
When two models have similar generalization errors, prefer the model with the lower complexity
