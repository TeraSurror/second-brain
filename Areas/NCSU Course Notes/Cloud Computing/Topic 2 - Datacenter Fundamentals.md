Datacenter is a place that houses IT resources

#### Business Driver for Datacenters
1. cost reduction - AWS has superior buying power
2. need to control the large pool of IT resources

#### Technology drivers for Datacenters
1. Server virtualization
2. Fast network enable connectivity of users and cloud resources

#### Components of a Datacenter:
1. Physical Plant - Power units, cooling, etc
2. Hardware - servers, compute and network
3. Software - applications that the users run on the hardware. as well as the software run by datacenter for admin
4. Human personnel


#### Hardware Components
Consists of the following components:
1. Physical compute servers
	- Provides the user with CPU and Memory (RAM)
	- Typically does not contain non volatile memory - Hard Disk
2. Physical storage servers
	- Provides the user with bytes (lots of bytes)
3. Switch Fabric
	- It is a network that connects the compute servers inside the data center
4. Gateways
	- Routers that connect the datacenter to the outside world


#### Software Components
Consists of the following components:
1. Consumer applications
	- Refers to the applications that the consumers/customers are running on the datacenter servers
2. Control Software
	- Runs on the hardware of the datacenter. 
	- Owned by the datacenter.
3. Management software 
	- Includes applications that implement management tasks.


#### Workloads
Applications that the users run on the severs are known as the "workload" of the datacenter
