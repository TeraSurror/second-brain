### Datacenter:
**The physical environment where cloud computing takes place**

- measured in number of servers, square footage, electric power, etc

#### Business drivers for DCs
1. Cost reduction: for the consumer
2. Complexity reduction: for the consumer
3. Profit for the cloud provider

#### Technology drivers for DCs
- server virtualization
- faster networks

##### Why is cost higher for a consumer?
- the "traditional" infrastructure cost models are no longer applicable for current day "workloads".
- owning infra to accommodate fluctuating workloads is costly - renting may be less expensive
- present day complexity has a lot of hidden costs as well
