**Topic:** Job roles in cloud

Homework problems for HW1 as well as Material in this lecture from in Topic 1
##### What is cloud computing
Art def: I do stuff on my computer and stuff happens in the air.
Gormit def: 
	cc is a model for enabling **ubiquitous**, **convenient**, **on demand** network access to a **shared** pool of configurable computing resources that can be **rapidly provisioned** and released with **minimal management** effort or **service provider interaction**.
Industrial ones:
	AWS: emphasis on cost features - **on demand** delivery of **IT resources** over the **Internet** with the pay as you go model for pricing.
	Microsoft: introduces the term "service" - delivery of computing services delivered over the internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale.
Ours:
	1. On demand provisioning of services.
	2. Minimal active management by the user.

###### Characteristics of cloud
1. on demand
2. elasticity
3. resource pooling
4. measured services

##### Identify potential employees
Divided into the following:
1. Providers (daddies) like google, aws and more
2. Consumers like netflix, salesforce and more

##### Identify what skills they need
Roles = "hats"
1. Architect
	1. for provider: puts the entire cloud arch together
	2. for consumer: 
2. automation engineer: works typically for the cloud service consumer  
There are more roles, but these  2 are discussed in the class (try to find job roles in the internet)
##### Clear the confusion about the hats

##### Describe what a cloud architect and cloud automation engineer does
I put things I have carefully selected together
Deliverable: produce only paper! - suggestions, designs and such
The deliverable should meet business/technical requirements.

**Load:** no. of requests
#### Automation engineer role in CC
Automation: tackles complexity of two main types:
1. Repetitive: configurations
2. Conceptual: Routing

what skills should a "good" cloud automation have?
1. Scripting
2. use of tools
