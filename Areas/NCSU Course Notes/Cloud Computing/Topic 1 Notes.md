This topic covers the following:
1. Job roles in cloud computing
2. Overview of Skills needed in cloud computing

**Computing**: The use of resources to run software applications. (loose definition)

There are 2 entities associated with a computing system:
1. The user
2. The manager/administrator


#### What is cloud computing?

**Art def:** 
	I do stuff on my computer and stuff happens in the air.

**Gormit def (actually called the NIST definition):** 
	**NIST:** National Institute of Standards and Technology
	**Definititon:** 
		Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly pro- visioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider inter- action.

**Industrial ones:**
	**AWS:** the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you- go pricing. (emphasis on the cost associated with computing)
	**Microsoft:** The delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
	.
	Both of the above definitions do not mention anything about the management entity
	
Ours:
	Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.



#### Characteristics of cloud computing:
1. **On demand self service**: Customer can get any resource they want without having to speak to a human representative.
2. **Broad Network Access**: Capabilities (i.e resources) are available over the internet, and can be accessed through phones, laptops, etc
3. **Resource Pooling**: Provider pools their resources and the customer is abstracted from the details of the location and other details of the resource.
4. **Rapid Elasticity**: Rapid provisioning of resources (sometimes even automatic).
5. **Measured Service**: Some level of telemetry is used to calculate and define resource usage so it can be optimized and/or compared.


#### Five actors in the cloud computing field

1. Cloud Consumer
2. Cloud Provider
3. Cloud Auditor
4. Cloud Broker
5. Cloud Carrier
