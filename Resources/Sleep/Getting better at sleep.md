### 2 forces that determine sleep
##### Adenosine:
- determines sleep "hunger". Causes sleepiness (if is increases naturally).
- Caffine blocks adenosine receptor.

##### Circadian "Force":
- circadian means 24 hours. We all have an internal clock.
- sleep and sleepiness is typically condensed in a 6-10 hour period.
- SUNLIGHT governs our need sleep.

### WAKE UP -> CORTISOL RELEASE -> MELATONIN TIMER BEGINS -> ALL SET FOR SLEEP CYCLE

**Cortisol "pulse" (release of some amount) wakes us up in the morning. It is important to get this pulses as early in the day as possible (early means after waking up).**

When we wake up a timer is started. this timer determines when melatonin (sleepy drug) will be released. This timer is started by the release of cortisol in the morning (healthy release as described above).

To start this cycle properly we need to get **sunlight** and only **sunlight** as early as possible.
Also we should get **direct sunlight**. NOT THROUGH glass and such.

### SUNSET ALSO SETS THE SLEEP CYCLE.

Naps can be good. Should be anywhere from 20 to 60 mins. But if you are feeling groggy, you most likely going into deep sleep.
