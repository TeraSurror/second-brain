Hello Danesha,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Harsh Jagdish Shelar, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at North Carolina State University, with an expected graduation date of May 2025. 

I am writing to inquire about possible part-time student programmer roles at your organization and to express my strong interest in the same.
  
Here are some of my strengths and skills:  
**1.** **Full Stack Expertise:** With a background in both front-end and back-end technologies, I possess hands-on experience with web and mobile frameworks such as React, Redux, Angular, Sass, Spring, and Flutter.  
**2. Programming Languages:** I am proficient in a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and Go, allowing me to adapt quickly to different project requirements.  
**3. Database and Operating Systems:** My expertise extends to databases such as Oracle PL/SQL, MongoDB, Firebase, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. I am well-versed in operating systems like Ubuntu and Windows.  
**4. Project Management:** In my previous role as a Technology Senior Analyst at Deutsche Bank, I successfully led the migration of a legacy reconciliation tool, demonstrating strong project management and problem-solving skills.  
**5. Machine Learning and AI:** I have practical experience in developing machine learning algorithms, including a deep fake detection algorithm using Keras with an accuracy of 81%, and an AI-based conversational bot developed in Flutter.   

I have attached my resume to this email for your reference. Please let me know if you need any further information from me.
  
Thanks a lot for your time and for considering my inquiry.
