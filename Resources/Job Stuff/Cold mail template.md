Hi Payel Islam, 

I hope all is well! My name is Harsh Jagdish Shelar, and I cam across the Software Engineering Summer Intern job posting on this link - https://app.joinhandshake.com/stu/jobs/8092465. I'm greatly interested in this role, as my experience and skills are relevant due to the following reasons:

1. I have worked at Deutsche Bank for 2 years, where I have built back-end systems for the bank's reconciliation tools and gained considerable experience in Java and the Spring Boot environment doing the same.
2. My stint at Deutsche Bank has given me experience in working with data intensive applications and the workflows and processes that go along with. I firmly believe this experience will enable me to contribute to the successful development of the company's products.
3. I have gained experience on working with React, React Native and Typescript at my internship in Fitlete, where I have built UI systems for their flagship app.

I'd love to get your in-depth opinion regarding my qualifications and what would be needed on my end to successfully get the above mentioned position.

Best,
Harsh

Hi Nicholas,
I came across the Software Engineer Intern role at ZS and would love to be considered for it. I am an NC State grad in the Master of Computer Science program. I think my experience in Java would make me a great fit for the role. Would love to connect with you and discuss. 
Thank you!
